# JC_Exercise
Coding exercise for JumpCloud

Overview:
In this exercise, I created a simple web service that accomplishes the following:
- Exposes an HTTP endpoint at the URL [/manage_file] that accepts a JSON payload
- Depending on the JSON payload, it will either download the sample text file or returns the contents of the text file & displays content in response.
- Ensures the service will return proper status codes for all requests
